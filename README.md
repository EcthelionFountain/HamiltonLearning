# HamiltonLearning
A repository to test how Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions might be used to imrove performance of learning algorithms in certain areas.

Combining features found in normal training with additional variables that can be incorporated in a Hamiltonian or Lagrangian function might be very useful in some situations.

This repository aims to see, how well this idea actually works in hopefully several instances.
